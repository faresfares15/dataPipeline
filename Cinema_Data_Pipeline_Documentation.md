# Cinema Data Pipeline Project

## Executive Summary

This project represents a comprehensive data engineering solution that I developed to analyze the movie industry by combining data from multiple sources. The main goal was to create an automated pipeline that could extract movie information from different APIs, process and analyze this data, and present meaningful insights through interactive dashboards.

The system successfully integrates data from three major sources: IMDB's public datasets, the Open Movie Database (OMDB) API, and The Movie Database (TMDB) API. By combining these diverse data sources, I was able to create a unified view of movie information that includes everything from basic details like titles and release dates to more complex metrics like box office performance and audience ratings.

## Project Overview and Motivation

### The Challenge

The movie industry generates vast amounts of data across multiple platforms and databases, but this information is often scattered and difficult to analyze comprehensively. Each data source has its own format, update schedule, and access methods, making it challenging to get a complete picture of movie performance and trends.

I identified this as an opportunity to create a system that could automatically gather, process, and analyze movie data from multiple sources to provide valuable insights for content creators, distributors, and industry analysts.

### What I Built

The solution I developed is an end-to-end data pipeline that runs on Apache Airflow for orchestration, uses Apache Spark for large-scale data processing, and stores results in Elasticsearch for fast searching and visualization through Kibana dashboards.

The pipeline automatically fetches data from external APIs, cleans and standardizes the information, performs analytical computations to identify trends and patterns, and makes everything available through interactive dashboards that stakeholders can use to make data-driven decisions.

## Technical Architecture and Design Decisions

### System Architecture

I designed the system following modern data engineering principles with a clear separation of concerns. The architecture consists of several layers that work together seamlessly.

The data ingestion layer handles all communication with external APIs and manages the complexities of rate limiting, authentication, and error handling. I implemented parallel processing to speed up data collection and built in retry mechanisms to handle temporary failures gracefully.

The processing layer takes the raw data from different sources and transforms it into a consistent format. This was particularly challenging because each API returns data in different structures with different field names and data types. I developed standardization routines that map fields across sources and handle missing or inconsistent data.

The analytics layer uses Apache Spark to perform complex calculations and generate insights. This includes analyzing genre popularity, tracking rating trends over time, and identifying top-performing directors and movies. Spark's distributed computing capabilities allow the system to handle large datasets efficiently.

Finally, the storage and visualization layer uses Elasticsearch to index the processed data and Kibana to create interactive dashboards. This combination provides fast search capabilities and flexible visualization options.

### Technology Choices

I chose Apache Airflow for orchestration because it provides excellent workflow management capabilities with a user-friendly web interface for monitoring and debugging. The ability to define complex dependencies between tasks and handle failures automatically made it ideal for this project.

For data processing, Apache Spark was the natural choice due to its ability to handle large datasets and perform complex analytical operations efficiently. The integration with Python through PySpark made it easy to implement custom analytics logic.

Elasticsearch and Kibana were selected for storage and visualization because they excel at handling time-series data and provide powerful search and aggregation capabilities. The combination allows users to explore the data interactively and create custom dashboards for different use cases.

## Data Sources and Integration Challenges

### Working with Multiple APIs

The project integrates three distinct data sources, each with its own characteristics and challenges.

IMDB provides comprehensive datasets in TSV format that include basic movie information, ratings, and cast details. While this data is extensive and reliable, it's updated weekly and requires significant processing to extract relevant information.

The OMDB API offers detailed movie metadata including plot summaries, box office figures, and awards information. However, it has strict rate limits (1000 requests per day on the free tier) that required careful request management and caching strategies.

TMDB provides rich movie data including budget information, revenue figures, and popularity scores. This API has more generous rate limits but requires a two-step process: first searching for movies by title, then fetching detailed information using movie IDs.

### Data Quality and Standardization

One of the biggest challenges was dealing with inconsistent data across sources. The same movie might have different titles, release dates, or genre classifications in different databases. I developed sophisticated matching algorithms that use fuzzy string matching and multiple identifiers to link records across sources.

Data quality issues were common, including missing values, inconsistent formatting, and duplicate records. I implemented comprehensive data cleaning routines that handle these issues systematically while preserving data integrity.

The standardization process involved creating a unified schema that could accommodate data from all sources while maintaining the unique information each source provides. This required careful analysis of field mappings and data type conversions.

## Pipeline Implementation and Workflow

### Automated Data Collection

The pipeline begins with automated data collection from the various APIs. I implemented parallel processing to speed up this phase, allowing multiple API calls to execute simultaneously while respecting rate limits.

Error handling was crucial here because external APIs can be unreliable. I built in exponential backoff retry logic that automatically handles temporary failures and logs detailed information for debugging when manual intervention is needed.

The system also includes data validation at the ingestion stage to catch problems early. This includes checking for required fields, validating data types, and ensuring that responses match expected formats.

### Data Processing and Transformation

Once data is collected, the processing phase transforms it into a consistent format suitable for analysis. This involves several steps including data cleaning, type conversion, and schema standardization.

I developed custom transformation logic for each data source that handles the specific quirks and formats of that source while producing standardized output. For example, OMDB returns genre information as comma-separated strings, while TMDB uses arrays of genre objects, but both are converted to a consistent list format.

The processing phase also includes data enrichment, where I combine information from multiple sources to create more complete movie profiles. This might involve merging box office data from OMDB with popularity scores from TMDB and ratings from IMDB.

### Analytics and Insight Generation

The analytics phase uses Apache Spark to perform complex calculations on the processed data. I implemented several analytical modules that generate different types of insights.

The movie analytics module calculates aggregate statistics like average ratings, total box office revenue, and distribution of movie lengths. It also identifies outliers and trends that might be interesting to stakeholders.

Genre analysis examines the popularity and performance of different movie genres over time. This includes calculating average ratings by genre, total revenue by genre, and tracking how genre preferences change over time.

Director and cast analysis identifies top performers based on various metrics like average movie ratings, total box office revenue, and career longevity. This information is valuable for casting decisions and industry analysis.

## Orchestration and Monitoring

### Workflow Management with Airflow

I designed the Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) to represent the entire pipeline as a series of connected tasks. The workflow follows a logical sequence: data extraction, formatting, analysis, indexing, and finally success notification.

Each task is designed to be idempotent, meaning it can be safely rerun without causing problems. This is important for reliability because it allows the system to recover from failures by simply restarting failed tasks.

The DAG includes comprehensive logging at each step, making it easy to debug issues and monitor performance. Task dependencies ensure that each step completes successfully before the next one begins, preventing data corruption or incomplete processing.

### Monitoring and Alerting

The system includes extensive monitoring capabilities that track both technical metrics and business KPIs. Technical monitoring covers things like task execution times, error rates, and resource usage.

Business monitoring tracks data quality metrics like the number of movies processed, data completeness percentages, and the freshness of the data. This helps ensure that the system is providing value to stakeholders.

I implemented alerting for critical failures that require immediate attention, while less critical issues are logged for review during regular maintenance windows.
